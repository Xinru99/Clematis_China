# Clematis Diversification Analysis in China

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in the study:  
**Zhang et al. (2025) "From Miocene radiation to spatial mismatch: Environmental and trait influences on _Clematis_ diversification across China"**.

The project focuses on analyzing the diversification patterns of _Clematis_ plants across China, incorporating environmental and trait data to understand evolutionary dynamics.

## Datasets

+ **Tree Files** 
   Includes 100 phylogenetic trees generated from TACT (Tree Analysis with Continuous Traits) simulations. These trees were used for diversification analyses in the study, representing uncertainty in tree topology and branch lengths.

+ **Distribution Data**
   Geographic distribution records for Clematis species across China. It includes location coordinates, environmental variables, and trait data used to assess spatial and ecological influences on diversification.

## Scripts

+ **Diversification Analyses**  
    - **BAMM**  
        - _**Run_priors.sh**_  
    
    - **ClaDS**  

    - **RPANDA**  
        + _**RPANDA.R**_
