# Spatial mismatch between species richness and diversification rates of _Clematis_ in China

This repository contains the datasets and scripts used in the study:  
**Zhang et al. (2026) "Environmental regimes and intrinsic traits drove the spatial mismatch between species richness and diversification rates of _Clematis_ in China"**.

The project focuses on analyzing the spatial mismatch between species richness and diversification rates of _Clematis_ in China, incorporating environmental and trait data to understand its underlying drivers.

## Datasets

+ **Tree Files** 
   Includes 100 phylogenetic trees generated from TACT (Tree Analysis with Continuous Traits) simulations. These trees were used for diversification analyses in the study, representing uncertainty in tree topology and branch lengths.

+ **Distribution Data**
   Geographic distribution records for Clematis species across China. It includes location coordinates, environmental variables used to assess spatial and ecological influences on diversification.

## Scripts

+ **Diversification Analyses**  
    - **BAMM**  
        - _**Run_priors.sh**_  
    
    - **ClaDS**  

    - **RPANDA**  
        + _**RPANDA.R**_
