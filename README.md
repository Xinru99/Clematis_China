# Spatial mismatch between species richness and diversification rates of _Clematis_ in China

This repository contains the data sets and scripts used in **Zhang et al. (2026) "Environmental regimes and traits drive the spatial mismatch between species richness and diversification rates of Chinese _Clematis_"**.

The project investigates the spatial mismatch pattern between species richness and diversification rates of _Clematis_ in China, by incorporating environmental and 36 trait data to elucidate the underlying drivers.

## Data sets

+ **100complete_trees** 
   Includes 100 phylogenetic trees generated from TACT (Taxonomic Addition for Complete Trees) simulations. These trees were used for diversification analyses in the study, representing uncertainty in tree topology and branch lengths.  

+ **Distribution_Data**  
  `Distribution_Data.csv` contains geographic distribution records for _Clematis_ species across China. It includes coordinates and environmental variables used to assess spatial and ecological influences on diversification.

+ Other relevant data and methods are available in the supplementary files.
